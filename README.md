### Purrfect-Paws
'Purrfect Paws' is a pet project developed by Iryna Denkova, a web developer with a passion for cats. As the developer of this project, I am committed to delivering the best possible user experience and ensuring that Purrfect Paws remains a top-notch brand in the pet food industry. 

## Design
The design for Purrfect Paws was created by me, with a focus on creating a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. I believe that design plays a crucial role in creating a positive user experience, and I have worked hard to ensure that every aspect of the Purrfect Paws website is visually appealing and easy to use.

## Technologies
I used React for building the user interface, styled-components for styling sections, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. I also use the GSAP plugin for creating animations that help bring the site to life.
